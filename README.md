# ulbuf
Ultra lightweight string buffer library for C

Extracted from the [yasf] project, this ultility provides a simplistic yet efficient implementaion of string buffers in C.

It is written in ANSI C and can be compiled as C++ code.

See `example.cc` for the usage. Compile and run it to see the time difference of different implementations of string buffers (static buffer, ulbuf, C++ STL `string` class).
